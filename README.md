## The Problem It Solves

Diabetes is a pervasive global health challenge, often diagnosed late, leading to severe complications. Several factors contribute to this:

1.  **Late Diagnosis:** Symptoms can be subtle or go unnoticed, leading to delayed diagnosis and progression of the disease.

2.  **Complex Risk Assessment:** Understanding individual risk factors for diabetes requires analyzing multiple physiological parameters, which can be overwhelming without specialized tools.

3.  **Lack of Proactive Tools:** Many individuals lack accessible, easy-to-use tools to regularly assess their diabetes risk based on their current health data.

4.  **Data Interpretation Challenges:** Medical data can be complex and difficult for non-experts to interpret, hindering informed decision-making.

5.  **Burden on Healthcare Professionals:** Manual assessment of diabetes risk for a large patient base is time-consuming and prone to human error.

These challenges highlight a critical need for intelligent, accessible, and proactive solutions to aid in early detection and risk management of diabetes.

## Tech Stack

Diascan-v-1.2 is built using a modern full-stack architecture:

**Frontend:**
* **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

**Backend:**
* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
* **Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy):** Used for data processing, model training, and inference within the backend services.

## How It Works (Under the Hood)

Diascan-v-1.2 operates through a well-defined full-stack machine learning pipeline:

1.  **User Interaction (Frontend - Next.js/React):**
    * The user accesses the web application and inputs physiological data (e.g., `Pregnancies`, `Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `SkinThickness`, `Insulin`, `BMI`, `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`, `Age`) via the intuitive React components.
    * This data is validated client-side for basic correctness and then sent to the backend API.

2.  **API Communication (Backend - FastAPI):**
    * The Next.js frontend makes an API request to the FastAPI backend.
    * FastAPI receives the data, performs further server-side validation, and directs it to the appropriate machine learning service.

3.  **Machine Learning Inference (Backend - Python/ML Libraries):**
    * Within the FastAPI service, the raw input data is preprocessed (e.g., handling missing values, scaling features) using libraries like Pandas and scikit-learn.
    * The preprocessed data is then fed into a pre-trained machine learning model. This model has been trained on a large dataset of patient health records, learning the complex patterns and relationships between input features and diabetes outcomes.
    * The model generates a prediction (e.g., a probability score or a binary outcome: Diabetic/Non-Diabetic).

4.  **Result Delivery & Visualization (Frontend - Next.js/React):**
    * The prediction outcome and any associated insights (e.g., feature importance data) are sent back from the FastAPI backend to the Next.js frontend.
    * The React components then render these results clearly and visually using charts and graphs, providing transparency and actionable insights to the user.

## Getting Started (Local Setup)

Follow these steps to get Diascan-v-1.2 up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm or yarn (package manager for Node.js)
* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* `git` (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dhrumil1128/Diascan-v-1.2.git](https://github.com/dhrumil1128/Diascan-v-1.2.git)
    cd Diascan-v-1.2
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    Navigate into your backend directory (e.g., `diascan-backend` or `fastapi` as indicated by your file structure, or `Backend_DiaType` for the main ML service).
    ```bash
    # Example: cd diascan-backend
    python -m venv venv_backend
    source venv_backend/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv_backend\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Make sure you have a requirements.txt in your backend folder
    ```
    *(Common backend dependencies include `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`.)*

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    Navigate back to the project root and then into your frontend directory (likely `app` or `src`).
    ```bash
    # Example: cd app (if frontend is in 'app' subdirectory)
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    From your backend directory:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload # Or whatever your main FastAPI app file is called
